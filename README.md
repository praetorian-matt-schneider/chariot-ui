## Description

Chariot is an expert-driven, all-in-one offensive security platform that helps organizations shift from a reactive "assume breach" mentality to a prevention-first strategy. By actively seeking out vulnerabilities and addressing potential weaknesses before attackers can exploit them, Chariot ensures a robust security posture through continuous offensive security testing.

⚠️ This repository mirrors the SaaS offering at preview.chariot.praetorian.com, enabling you to customize your full user experience.

## Key Features

- **Attack Surface Management**: Continuously monitor all attack vectors including external, internal, cloud, web app, secrets, phishing, rogue IT, and supplier/vendor risk.
- **Continuous Penetration Testing**: Perform strategic, adversarial-focused assessments to identify critical issues.
- **Continuous Red Teaming**: Test your cybersecurity program’s resilience over time.
- **Breach & Attack Simulation**: Simulate known exploitations to identify gaps in prevention and detection plans.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.14.0)
- npm (10.7.0)
- `mkcert` (for creating local HTTPS certificates)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/praetorian-inc/chariot-ui.git
   cd chariot-ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up HTTPS certificates using `mkcert`:

   ```sh
   mkdir certs && cd certs
   npx mkcert create-ca
   npx mkcert create-cert
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the app on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

### Building the Project

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `build` directory.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Adding New Charts

To add new charts to the Chariot platform, contributors will need to define a new aggregate within the `AggregateCollection`. This process involves configuring a new `defineAggregate` instance, which shapes how data is processed and visualized within the chart.

### Steps to Create a New Chart

1. **Define the Data Type**:
   Ensure that the data type (e.g., `Asset`, `Risk`, `Seed`) is accurately defined in `@/types`. This TypeScript interface should clearly describe the structure of the data, which is essential for accurately accessing and aggregating the data fields.

2. **Create a New Aggregate**:
   In the relevant aggregate file (e.g., `src/utils/aggregates/asset.ts`, `src/utils/aggregates/seed.ts`), utilize the `defineAggregate` function to define your new chart. Provide:

   - A meaningful label for the chart.
   - A function to extract the key for grouping data.
   - The field name (`xField`) for the grouping key.
   - The field name (`yField`) for the aggregated value.

   Example:

   ```typescript
   defineAggregate<Risk>(
     'Count of Risks by Status',
     risk => risk.status,
     'status',
     'count'
   );
   ```

3. **Add to `AggregateCollection`**:
   Include your new aggregate definition in the respective collection, making it available across the application.

4. **Utilize the Aggregate**:
   Employ the `runAggregate` and `getAggregates` generic functions to execute and retrieve your new aggregate's results, respectively.

### Types and Utilities

- **Types**: Defined in `@/types`, these interfaces help ensure that data handling is type-safe and clear to all contributors.
- **Utilities**: Common utilities like `getDateFromISO` should be used for data manipulation to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.
